				OKOKOK
			
				
				
				BACK TO CLASS
			
				
				
				
			

				
				perry
			
				
				
				is this your definition?
			
				
				
				(i am done with wb)
			
				
<br>				perry:
				yep!
			
				
				
				err
			
				
				
				
			
				
<br>				avital:
				ok is this the definition everyone believes in?
			

				
				are there other possible definitions?
			
				
<br>				perry:
				we should save this masterpiece
			
				
<br>				avital:
				perry yes please save it

<br>				avital:
				awesome thanks
			
				
				
				so we seem to all agree that this is the definition...?
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				indeed
			

<br>				avital:
				ok
			
				
				
				yes perry please speak
			
				
<br>				perry:
				I\'ve also been told that it\'s the ratio of the area of a circle to the square of its radius
			
				
<br>				avital:
				oh tomer and jerry have you also heard this before?
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				yep
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				perchance
			
				
<br>				avital:
				perry could you draw that diagram please
			

<br>				perry:

<br>				tomer:
				you could\'ve added it to the last one
			
				
<br>				avital:
				maybe we can still load the old one
			
				
				
				and draw on it
			
				
				
				
			
				
<br>				perry:
				ok
			
				
				
				
			
				
<br>				avital:
				OHOHOHOH
			

				
				we can make this smaller
			
				
				
				
			
				
<br>				perry:
				not sure how to color it in
			
				
				
				
			
				
<br>				avital:
				just brush it in somehow
			

				
				nice, thanks perry
			
				
<br>				perry:
				yuck but ok
			
				
<br>				avital:
				do we all agree?
			
				
<br>				perry:
				
			
				
<br>				avital:
				ok.
			
				
<br>				perry:

pi = c/d = A / (r^2)

<br>				avital:
				before we continue, is there a slightly different way to explain the same thing perry just said?
			
				
				
				perhaps simpler in some sense?
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				i don\'t know if it\'s important but it might be better to draw a square with the radius as its side
			
				
<br>				avital:
				tomer could you please draw that?
			

				
				nice
			
				
				
				ok SO
			
				
				
				why is this true?
			
				
				
				why is C/D = A/r^2
			

				
				thoughts?
			
				
				
				half-thoughts?
			

<br>				perry:
				<img src='http://www.twiddla.com//images/arrow1.gif' alt=''/> http://www.twiddla.com/addins/blank.html - cached
			

<br>				avital:
				quarter-thoughts?
			

<br>				tomer:
				quarter
			
				
				
				i also heard that circle is the most efficient shape in manner of perimeter to area
			

				
				don\'t know
			
				
<br>				avital:
				yes tomer i\'ve also heard that
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				i guess it works with a square too
			
				
<br>				avital:
				here\'s a link to another room in which that was discovered: 
			
				
				
				what do you mean \'works with a square\'
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				:)
			
				
<br>				avital:
				so maybe in order to understand this
			
				
				
				we first need to understand a bit more about how we can reason about the area or circumference of a circle
			

				
				oh tomer do you mean this formule is also true for a square
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				i have no idea
			
				
				
				the equivalence
			
				
				
				yeah
			

<br>				avital:
				ok
			
				
				
				let\'s draw soething fresh

<br>				jerry:
				yes fresh

				<img src='http://www.twiddla.com//images/arrow1.gif' alt=''/> http://www.twiddla.com/addins/blank.html - cached
			

				
				how can we reason about the circumference of a circle
			
				
				
				at all
			
				
				
				like
			
				
				
				if i were to ask you
			
				
				
<br>				:
			
				
				
				what is the circumference of this cricle
			
				
				
				circle
			
				
				
				how could you do it
			
				
				
				(all ways are legitimate!)
			
				
<br>				perry:
				i\'ll put a string up to the screen
			
				
				
				wrap it around, mark it, and then bust out my ruler
			
				
<br>				avital:
				sounds like a great idea, what does or doesn\'t work with this idea?
			
				
<br>				perry:
				?
			

				
				well i don\'t have a string or a ruler
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				where can i get this ruler?
			
				
<br>				avital:
				hehehe
			
				
				
				i can give them to you
			
				
<br>				perry:
				it\'s also fairly inexact
			
				
<br>				avital:
				well yes the benefits are that it\'s quite immediate
			
				
				
				and ruler and string are pretty simple to get ahold of
			
				
				
				but of course it isn\'t exact
			
				
				
				so we would never be able to prove that it EQUALS something else
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				do we know anything about other shapes
			
				
<br>				avital:
				which is what we\'re trying to do
			

				
				jerry yeah not sure exactly what the framing of this discussion is so yes
			
				
				
				we know some stuff about other shapes
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				triangles?
			
				
				
				maybe a triangle could help us
			
				
<br>				avital:
				sure what would you like to do with triangles?
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				well do we know anything about measuring them
			

<br>				avital:
				perhaps we know various things. maybe tomer knows. would you like to present a half-idea?
			
				
				
				hahah also maybe perry knows
			
				
<br>				perry:
				about triangles or about this circle?
			
				
<br>				avital:
				about triangles
			
				
<br>				perry:
				
			

<br>				jerry:
				meebe triangles are not so friendly today to help us
			
				
<br>				avital:
				oh jerry but did you have a half-thought
			
				
				
				on the manner?
			
				
				
				because dead-end half-thoughts are very important
			

<br>				jerry:
				just that if we knew something about measuring triangles we might be able to use that for measuring things about circles
			
				
<br>				avital:
				aha
			
				
				
				may i suggest a half-thought?
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				i have only one thought and i don\'t want to resort to that yet because it envolves infinity
			
				
<br>				avital:
				hahahaha
			
				
				
				do you think that thought is a naive thought about infinity?
			

<br>				tomer:
				yeah i guess
			
				
<br>				avital:
				yes please present it then
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				it involves other shapes we know
			
				
				
				polygons
			
				
<br>				avital:
				would you like to draw and explain
			

<br>				tomer:
				maybe the most natural way to describe it is that a circle is a perfect(?) polygon with infinite sides
			
				
				
				×ž×©×•×›×œ×œ?
			
				
<br>				avital:
				(perfect = regular)
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				that\'s it
			

<br>				avital:
				yes tomer that sounds like a nice idea. so for example
			
				
				
				if we look at a 20 sided polygon
			
				
				
				i will draw
			
				
				
				(try to draw)
			
				
				
				
			
				
				
				pok heheheh
			
				
				
				i got 13 sides
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				13=20
			
				
<br>				avital:
				yes
			
				
				
				13=20
			
				
				
				in base 17
			
				
				
				so
			

				
				tomer can we say something about this 13 sided polygon
			
				
				
				or is what you\'re saying only true about infinity
			
				
				
				(i mean about this 13 sided polygon and its relation to the circle)
			
				
				
				or not just tomer
			
				
<br>				perry:
				
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				that it\'s closer to a cricle than a 12 sided polygon?
			
				
<br>				avital:
				tomer i agree
			
				
				
				perry?
			

<br>				perry:
				well going back to jerry\'s triangles
			
				
<br>				avital:
				"jerry\'s triangles"
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				yeah thats right
			
				
<br>				perry:
				or pythagoraus\'s
			
				
				
				whoever\'s
			
				
<br>				avital:
				yes
			
				
				
				what about them please
			

<br>				jerry:
				oooh
			
				
<br>				avital:
				the wheel of dharme
			
				
				
				dharma
			
				
				
				perry are you still drawing?
			
				
<br>				perry:
				
			

				
				ok now i\'m done
			
				
<br>				avital:
				nice
			

				
				anyone have thoughts?
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				it looks like theres a line that both triangle and circle share
			
				
<br>				avital:
				what do you mean
			

<br>				jerry:
				the dotted line
			
				
				
				or any of the lines really
			
				
<br>				perry:
				err, i drew the dotted line badly
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				not all of them
			
				
<br>				avital:
				perry would you like to correct the line?
			
				
<br>				perry:
				
			

<br>				avital:
				there\'s an erase tool
			
				
				
				
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				can u use different color pls?
			
				
<br>				avital:
				or maybe we should draw this much larger?
			
				
<br>				perry:
				ya
			
				
<br>				avital:
				would you like to do that perry?
			
				
<br>				perry:
				ill give it a shot

				im not
			

				
				avi you wanna draw these lines?
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				line tool
			
				
<br>				perry:
				i\'m not very proficient or patient or something
			
				
<br>				avital:
				jerry?
			
				
<br>				perry:
				
			
				
<br>				avital:
				want to draw
			
				
				
				
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				nothx
			
				
<br>				avital:
				oh you dont have tablet
			
				
				
				ok
			
				
				
				ehehehfsdjgsekj
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				i do
			
				
<br>				avital:
				dvsgd
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				but i am bad at it
			
				
<br>				avital:
				oh@#R
			
				
				
				@#%@#@$@$
			
				
<br>				perry:
				let\'s do 8 sided
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				cause i haven\'t played with it enough to be skilled
			
				
<br>				avital:
				lets jsut do less sides
			

<br>				jerry:
				hahaha
			
				
<br>				avital:
				yes 8 sided
			
				
				
				8
			
				
				
				8

				8D
			
				
				
				OH YEAH
			
				
				
				THIS LOOKS GOOOOOOOD
			
				
<br>				perry:
				
			

<br>				jerry:
				yes that\'s quite striking
			
				
				
				oh yes so the green line then is not quite to the outside of the circle
			
				
<br>				perry:
				that\'s a pretty crooked height there
			
				
<br>				avital:
				yes
			
				
				
				that looks nice

<br>				tomer:
				are we trying to convince ourselves that pi=c/d?
			
				
				
				or are we trying to calculate pi?
			
				
<br>				avital:
				that c/d = a/r^2
			
				
				
				well
			
				
				
				maybe we need to reason about calculating pi on the way
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				or that too yeah
			
				
<br>				avital:
				maybe not
			
				
				
				but we are aiming to prove that c/d = a/r^2
			

<br>				tomer:
				we\'re just going with what we have
			
				
<br>				avital:
				so does this magnificent diagram
			
				
				
				give us some hints towards c/d = a/r^2?
			
				
				
				like perry previously
			
				
				
				you spoke of the area of this triangle
			
				
				
				why?
			

<br>				perry:
				well if we can find some sort of pattern re the area of these triangles
			
				
<br>				avital:
				
			
				
<br>				perry:
				in hexagons versus octagons versus ...
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				but how do we even calcute h?
			
				
<br>				perry:
				then as tomer suggests we can extrapolate what the sum of an infinite number of traingles would be
			
				
<br>				avital:
				how can we calculate h as tomer asks or also b?

				but perry yes i agree
			
				
				
				that someone we should be able to think about this
			
				
				
				for a N-sided polygon
			
				
				
				and then reason somehow about what happen when N gets very large
			
				
				
				so like
			
				
				
				tomer
			
				
				
				you asked how we can know what h is
			
				
				
				and i agree that it seems quite hard
			

				
				BUT let\'s all remember that we\'re not really thinking about a 8-sided polygon here
			
				
<br>				perry:
				well we know r and we know an angle
			
				
<br>				avital:
				yes but we officially don\'t know trigonometry now.
			
				
<br>				perry:
				sorry, keep going
			
				
<br>				avital:
				hehehe
			
				
				
				np
			
				
				
				so
			
				
				
				remember that we are just using the 8-sided polygon as sort of an approximation or somethin gof the circle
			

<br>				tomer:
				yeah actually b is the important thing because once we have a pattern for b we can have a formula for the circumference and the area
			

				
				and i\'m still wondering if we have to go through all this just to prove the equivalence c/d=a/r^2
			
				
<br>				avital:
				why is b all we need? do we know h?
			
				
				
				and as for your second question, perhaps we don\'t, do you have another suggestion?
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				pythagoras
			
				
<br>				perry:
				
			
				
<br>				avital:
				"pythagoras\' means "the pythagorean theorem"
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				it feels like too much work but i have no clue
			
				
<br>				avital:
				hahaha
			
				
				
				this IS hard work!
			
				
				
				i mean it really is
			

<br>				tomer:
				maybe we should back to what i said about the square and maybe it works for every regular plygon
			
				
				
				hmmmmm
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				it took us like 3 classes to do pythagorean
			
				
<br>				avital:
				also i will go to the restroom, be back in 1 minute
			
				
<br>				perry:
				me too
			

<br>				avital:
				i am back
			
				
<br>				perry:
				me2
			

<br>				jerry:
				yes
			
				
<br>				avital:
				tomer?
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				yep
			
				
				
				so what about what i suggested?
			
				
<br>				avital:
				sure do you want to explore that
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				we just need to figure out what diameter and radius mean in polygnos
			

				
				i think i will
			
				
<br>				avital:
				yes please draw it and explain what you are exploring
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				maybe i will do a quick research alone and come back with my results?
			
				
				
				i\'m not sure it even works for a square
			
				
<br>				avital:
				yes you could/should do that
			

<br>				perry:
				in the meantime...back to what avi was saying... maybe we don\'t calculate b
			
				
<br>				avital:
				do other people have some ideas they\'d like to explore or should i continue suggesting some questions?
			
				
				
				oh
			
				
				
				perry
			
				
				
				what do you mean
			
				
<br>				perry:
				but we estimate it as the length of the area of the circle it encapsulates
			
				
				
				sorry, the length of the circle it encapsulates
			
				
<br>				avital:
				perry how would we do that?
			

<br>				perry:
				well it\'d be 1/8C * 1/2
			
				
<br>				avital:
				well my b was supposed to be the whole length
			
				
				
				
			
				
<br>				perry:
				oh
			
				
				
				so just 1/8C then
			
				
<br>				avital:

				yes
			
				
				
				so i agree that b is approximately 1/8C
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				may i interrupt?
			
				
<br>				avital:
				yes tomer
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				ok i want to draw but i need to clear this one
			
				
<br>				avital:
				
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				
			

<br>				tomer:
				<img src='http://www.twiddla.com//images/arrow1.gif' alt=''/> http://www.twiddla.com/addins/blank.html - cached
			

<br>				avital:
				
			

				
				whaTTTTT
			
				
				
				so many symbolsssss
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				ok, so every regular polygon has a center
			
				
				
				the symbols are for relating to what we do
			

<br>				avital:
				yes well perhaps this could\'ve been done with less symbols
			
				
				
				but let\'s proceed
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				so i tried
			
				
<br>				avital:
				ok
			
				
				
				but what are you saying here?
			

<br>				tomer:
				first i tried that the diameter would be the "alachson"
			
				
				
				avital?
			
				
<br>				avital:
				diameter
			
				
				
				oh no
			
				
				
				ehehehhe
			
				
				
				fshidovklcm
			
				
				
				uhh
			
				
				
				diagonal
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				ok so i tried that but then it didn\'t work
			
				
<br>				avital:
				what is "it"
			
				
				
				what are you talking about
			

				
				no
			
				
				
				what at all
			
				
				
				high-level
			
				
				
				what are you talking about
			
				
<br>				perry:
				
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				nobody understands me?
			
				
<br>				avital:
				i just see a bunch of symbols
			
				
				
				i am sure some readers now don\'t understand you
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				ooof avital
			
				
<br>				perry:
				i see what you\'re getting at
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				let me explain not that many symbols
			
				
				
				i only added x
			
				
<br>				avital:
				not the symbols
			

				
				listen
			
				
				
				tomer
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				and now s to explain myself
			
				
<br>				avital:
				just
			
				
				
				describe
			
				
				
				give a title
			
				
				
				to this idea path
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				i\'m trying to check whether the formula
			
				
				
				c/d=a/r^2
			
				
				
				holds for every regular polygon
			

				
				if it is, i have a good reason to believe it holds for a circle
			
				
<br>				avital:
				ok thank you
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				problem is
			
				
<br>				avital:
				and now i guess
			
				
				
				you are talking about what a radius is
			
				
				
				in a polygon
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				what are the radius and diameter in a polygon
			
				
<br>				avital:
				or how we could interpret radius and diameter
			
				
				
				yes
			
				
<br>				perry:
				
			
				
<br>				avital:
				yes this sounds like a nice plan
			
				
				
				so you tried defining the diameter as the diagonal
			
				
				
				in the square?
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				i said that before maybe i wasn\'t too clear about it
			
				
<br>				avital:
				and you worked that out and it didn\'t work
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				yes
			

<br>				avital:
				(you said it before but not now when you erased the board and started over again)
			
				
				
				ok
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				so now i suggest this
			
				
				
				the radius is a vertical line from the "center" to on of the sides
			
				
				
				the diameter is two time that radius
			
				
<br>				avital:
				one* of the sides
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				times
			
				
<br>				avital:
				yes ok
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				on=one
			

<br>				avital:
				so can we erase this "s"
			
				
				
				that you have in the diagram?
			
				
				
				ok
			
				
				
				so
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				now
			
				
<br>				avital:
				yes this is nice
			
				
				
				so i nthis case
			
				
				
				A/r^2 = 4
			
				
				
				and C/2r = 4
			
				
				
				C/d
			
				
				
				
			
				
				
				(2r=d)
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				as you can see, if you understand my virtual handwriting
			
				
				
				exactly
			
				
<br>				avital:
				awesome
			
				
				
				so for our new interpretation of radius and diameter
			

				
				C/d = A/r^2 holds for a square
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				now i can try it on other pol
			
				
<br>				avital:
				now can we check if this is true for other polygons
			
				
				
				yes
			
				
<br>				perry:
				to be clear --
			
				
				
				
			
				
				
				"distance from center to one of sides"
			

				
				we mean *shortest" distance from center to one of sides?
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				you can call it that yeah
			
				
<br>				avital:
				a straight line
			
				
				
				between teh center and the center of one side
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				because it\'s pretty obvious that this distance is the length of a vertical line
			
				
<br>				perry:
				the center of one side, ok
			
				
<br>				avital:
				not sure what you mean by "vertical line" but think it\'s not important
			
				
				
				yes
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				i prefer my definition
			
				
<br>				avital:
				so how do we proceed to checking other polygons?
			

<br>				tomer:
				of course it\'s the same for regular polygons
			
				
				
				we just do that
			
				
<br>				perry:
				oh sorry avi corrected, ok i\'m on board
			
				
<br>				avital:
				ok cool
			
				
				
				tomer
			
				
				
				please draw some explorations
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				i can continue alone and you can go back to what you did
			
				
<br>				avital:
				oh
			
				
				
				but yours sounds nicer now
			
				
				
				hehehe
			
				
				
				or not
			
				
				
				ok
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				wahtever you want
			
				
<br>				avital:
				perry would you like to continue the discussion
			
				
<br>				perry:
				let\'s do a hexagon!
			
				
<br>				avital:
				about b = C/N
			

<br>				perry:
				oh ok
			
				
<br>				avital:
				no imean
			
				
				
				either way is fine :)
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				go for it perry
			
				
<br>				avital:
				heheheheheh
			
				
				
				we\'re too nice
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				let\'s save this and draw a hexagon or something
			
				
<br>				perry:
				
			
				
<br>				avital:

<br>				avital:
				hexagon
			
				
				
				
			

<br>				perry:
				
			
				
<br>				avital:
				ok
			
				
				
				so i think we should continue on tomer\'s path
			
				
				
				since its so nice
			
				
				
				and if we fail we can go back to perry\'s path
			
				
				
				and if we succeed we can do the same
			

<br>				tomer:
				ok
			
				
				
				sooo
			

				
				i think it becomes pretty similar to what we did before..
			
				
<br>				perry:
				yea, i think we\'re back to calculating D
			
				
				
				or h or whatever
			
				
				
				no?
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				damn
			
				
				
				i though it could be more easy
			
				
<br>				perry:
				
			

				
				it was a good exploration...but
			
				
<br>				avital:
				so my understanding from the future is that if we want to figure out r/d/h in this case
			
				
				
				we would need the pythagorea theorem
			
				
				
				we may choose to do that and go down that path
			
				
				
				or try to find a way that does\'t require that theorem
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				i\'m cool with that
			
				
<br>				avital:
				cool with which
			

<br>				tomer:
				use the pythagorean theorem
			
				
<br>				avital:
				ok i am also cool with that
			
				
				
<br>				(note:
			
				
				
				in the future here
			
				
				
				we will split out into another dicsussion
			
				
				
				in which we don\'t assume the pyhtaogrean theorem)
			
				
				
				ok
			
				
				
				so
			
				
				
				if we know the pythagorean theorem
			

				
				can we calculate D and r here?
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				with a little geometry also..
			
				
<br>				perry:
				well we only know one length
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				(its unfortunate that the chat auto scrolls to bottom when a new chat is entered....can\'t look up easily in the record)
			
				
<br>				perry:
				so we either need to approximate x
			
				
				
				or a little geometry
			
				
				
				
			
				
<br>				avital:
				jerry hmmm you can look at the transcript perhaps
			
				
				
				we will ensure that is easily accessible

				its easier to draw a regular hexagon

<br>				perry:
				sure, then we can remove the circle

				ok
			
				
				
				so now what
			
				
				
				
			
				
<br>				perry:
				
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				so the first thing i can see is that..
			
				
				
				can i draw?
			

<br>				avital:
				yes
			
				
				
				please draw
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				hmm
			
				
				
				now i have two things to draw
			
				
				
				i will draw both
			
				
<br>				avital:
				
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				first one is this
			
				
<br>				avital:
				also please write explicitly on the board what we are trying to prove
			

<br>				tomer:
				we can show that this is an equal sided triangle
			
				
<br>				avital:
				"equilateral"
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				or whatever you call it
			
				
<br>				perry:
				
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				ok
			
				
				
				because you have six of these
			

				
				so the "central" angle of each one is 60
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				and we also know that the two radii are equal
			

				
				the circle helps us here
			
				
				
				and we get that this is an equilateral
			
				
<br>				perry:
				well to be clear here
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				right?
			
				
<br>				perry:
				this isn\'t radii as we defined them in the square example
			
				
				
				the radius how we defined in the square example is like the R as labeled
			

				
				from center of shape to center of one of the dies
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				yeah
			
				
<br>				perry:
				sides *
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				i was talking about the circle radii
			
				
<br>				perry:
				right
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				it is confusing
			
				
<br>				perry:
				call them Rhex and Rcirc or something? or is that even more confusing?
			

<br>				avital:
				I support Rhex and Rcirc
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				radius is our radius, circle radius is circle radius
			
				
				
				?
			
				
<br>				avital:
				no
			
				
				
				make both explicit
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				:(
			
				
<br>				avital:
				
			
				
<br>				perry:
				
			

<br>				tomer:
				anyways,we agree that this is an equilateral and we can continue from here to calculate the polygon radius
			
				
				
				but..
			
				
<br>				perry:
				good
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				we also have this
			

<br>				avital:
				what about that
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				maybe it is easier calculating here
			

<br>				avital:
				
			
				
				
				what are we actually trying to findnow?
			

<br>				perry:
				area methinks
			
				
<br>				avital:
				
			

<br>				tomer:
				we know (?) that each angle of the regular hexagon is 120
			
				
<br>				avital:
				lets say we do
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				oh maybe it\'s the same
			
				
				
				:)O
			
				
<br>				avital:
				but tomer
			
				
				
				what are we actually doing now
			
				
				
				i mean what are we trying to do
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				i thought we can get different angles
			

<br>				avital:
				why would we want to do that
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				i\'m taking you to wild goose chases all the time
			
				
<br>				avital:
				but
			
				
				
				i don\'t understand
			
				
				
				we should be able to define our goal
			
				
				
<br>				i think it is:
			
				
				
				compute A
			
				
				
				and
			
				
				
				compute C
			
				
<br>				perry:
				i think we want to calculate the length of each side of the hex in terms of rhex
			
				
<br>				avital:
				...?
			
				
<br>				perry:
				to help us compute A & C
			

<br>				avital:
				ok so now that we\'ve explicit stated our goal: computing A and C
			
				
				
				we can talk about them
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				perry said something else
			
				
<br>				avital:
				no he suggested a strategy
			
				
				
				that sounds like a great strategy
			
				
				
				how can we find the length of a side of the hexagon
			
				
				
				
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				oooh
			
				
<br>				avital:

				may i suggest an idea
			
				
<br>				perry:
				pls do
			
				
<br>				avital:
				we seem to have agreed that we have an equilatral triangle
			
				
				
				
			

				
				so
			
				
				
				
			
				
				
				we know that all three sides of that triangle are x
			
				
				
				also
			
				
				
				since our radius line
			
				
				
				(Rhex)
			
				
				
				is defined to be the line to the middle of the side
			
				
				
				we know that x/2 length as drawn
			

				
				and
			
				
				
				we know we have a right angle...? (why actually?)
			
				
				
				does any of this make sense?
			
				
<br>				perry:
				b/c it bisects a line
			
				
				
				well, that\'s not very convincing actually
			
				
<br>				avital:
				not every line that bisects a line
			
				
				
				forms a right angle
			

				
				well it seems like a right angle to me
			
				
				
				i\'m willing to guess that for now
			
				
				
				but if we do
			
				
				
				we have a lot with which to work
			

				
				such as
			
				
				
				we have a right angles triangle
			
				
				
				and we know some sides
			
				
<br>				perry:
				now we can just pythag it
			
				
<br>				avital:
				
			
				
				
				yes
			
				
				
				what do we get when we pythag it
			
				
				
				
			

				
				awesome!

				so can we find C and D perhasp now?
			
				
				
				nice
			
				
<br>				perry:
				yes?
			
				
<br>				avital:
				and D

<br>				perry:
				
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				whoooa
			
				
<br>				avital:
				yes i think so
			

<br>				jerry:
				that\'s cray cray
			
				
<br>				avital:
				C looks good to me
			
				
				
				can we find D as well?
			
				
				
				oih
			
				
				
				hehehe
			
				
				
				not D
			
				
				
				heheheheheheheh
			
				
				
				A
			
				
				
				we don\'t even speak of D anymore
			
				
<br>				perry:
				yes, tis only 2Rhex
			
				
<br>				avital:
				ok what is A
			

				
				I think
			
				
				
				if we find the area fo the triangle
			
				
				
				lets call that Atri
			
				
				
				then A = Atri  * 6
			
				
<br>				perry:
				da
			
				
<br>				avital:
				and Atri =
			
				
				
				ok i will draw \'
			
				
				
				
			

				
				is that right?
			
				
<br>				perry:
				
			
				
<br>				avital:
				
			

				
				AWESOME
			
				
				
				So let\'s see if the equality holds (A/rhex^2 = C/2rhex)

<br>				tomer:
				:)
			
				
<br>				avital:
				YESSSSS
			
				
				
				so
			
				
				
				!@#$@
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				the problem is that from now on it won\'t be that easy..
			

<br>				avital:
				this identity (A/r^2 = C/2r) holds for a square and hexagon, if we choose the interpration we chose for radius
			
				
				
				yes tomer i agree
			
				
				
				we assumed properties of equilateral triangles
			
				
				
				just becasue it happened to be 60 degrees
			
				
				
				for this case
			
				
				
				if it weren\'t 60 degrees i don\'t know what we would\'ve done
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				i guess the next case we would like to check is octagon?
			
				
<br>				avital:
				we could try yes

				so can we find x
			
				
				
				if we know Roct
			
				
				
				or such
			

<br>				perry:
				well can we use trig & try to abstract?
			
				
				
				or no trig
			
				
<br>				avital:
				no trig
			

				
				thoughts? half-thoughts?
			

				
				honestly
			
				
				
				i dont know what we could do here
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				i have something
			
				
<br>				avital:
				oh
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				but it\'s complicated
			
				
<br>				avital:
				hehehehehee
			

<br>				tomer:
				and i\'m not 100% sure about and i have been wrong before
			
				
				
				...
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				try it

				yeah try it

				hmm wish the chat had timestamp meebe
			

				
				i forgot to look
			
				
				
				at time
			
				
<br>				avital:
				hehehe
			

				
				
			

				
				tomer do you have an idea to prsesent?
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				ok i can\'t really say how i got there
			
				
				
				i just kinda played with it
			

				
				<img src='http://www.twiddla.com//images/arrow1.gif' alt=''/> http://www.twiddla.com/addins/blank.html - cached
			

				
				do you want me to explain the drawing?
			
				
<br>				avital:
				i think i understand the drawing
			
				
				
				you are just drawing the diameter movd a litle
			
				
<br>				perry:
				at least how you know that\'s d?
			

<br>				tomer:
				two vertical lines to two parallel lines
			
				
				
				we get a rectangle
			
				
<br>				avital:
				i mean
			
				
				
				could you draw what we all agree d is
			
				
				
				and then explain from there
			
				
				
				yeah
			
				
				
				its just parallel to that
			

				
				perry does that explain it?
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				and the same level of geometry for the rest of it
			
				
				
				the octagon\'s angles are 135
			
				
<br>				perry:
				sure
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				so we get a 45 angle here
			
				
<br>				avital:
				i want to stop for a second though
			
				
				
				cause
			
				
				
				regardless of what you are doing here
			
				
				
				you are using the fact that we have 45 degrees
			

				
<br>				so my question is:
			
				
				
				would yo ube able to do this if it were a 10-sided polygon
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				good question
			
				
<br>				avital:

<br>				jerry:
				well its just 360/n-sides
			
				
				
				or something
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				it\'s hard to apply what i\'m doing here to other triangles
			
				
<br>				perry:
				1 sec...
			

<br>				avital:
				jerry yes, but i am a mind-reader and tomer is oging to use that 45 degrees to say that the two sides of that triangle are equal
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				othe polygons i mean
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				why can\'t we do that?
			
				
				
				too much prior knowledge?
			
				
<br>				avital:
				jerry we can def. use our knowledge of 45 drgees
			
				
				
				but that just happened to come out of us looking at a 8 sided polygon
			

				
				just like when we looked at a hexagon
			
				
				
				we got 60 drgeees
			
				
				
				which was also nice and easy
			
				
				
				but in almost any other case
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				ooh so like 18sided would be some crazy angle?
			
				
<br>				avital:
				yes exactly
			
				
				
				an angle about which we don\'t know anything without trigonometry
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				right
			

<br>				avital:
				.,.
			
				
				
				`\'`
			
				
				
				-~-
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				rgr
			
				
<br>				avital:
				thoughts?
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				oooh
			
				
				
				we are trying to find x?
			

<br>				avital:
				we are trying to relate x and d
			
				
				
				i think
			
				
<br>				perry:
				
			
				
<br>				avital:
				such as find x based on d
			
				
				
				or the other way around
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				i see
			
				
<br>				avital:
				i think this is actually genuinely a really hard problem
			
				
				
				for a general regular polygon
			

<br>				perry:
				without trig it certainly seems that way... could we put a square around it & see what happens?
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				yeah but it wasn\'t sheer "luck" that i head a 45 degree angle
			
				
<br>				avital:
				sure please do that but remember that we are looking for soemthing that will work not only for a 10-sided polygon
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				i had
			
				
				
				not head
			
				
<br>				perry:
				yes but any regular polygon can fit inside a square
			
				
				
				
			

				
				this may be a fast track to nowhere
			
				
<br>				avital:
				hahaHAhaha
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				:)
			
				
<br>				perry:
				i just wanna make a bunch of triangles and squares
			

<br>				avital:
				do we have some more ideas? or perhaps shall we go back to a line of thought perry started a while ago?
			
				
<br>				perry:
				which is kinda how i first learned to prove pythag
			
				
				
				but yea, let\'s not do this
			
				
				
				
			
				
<br>				avital:
				
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				let\'s learn some stats
			
				
				
				:p
			
				
<br>				avital:
				hahahahha yes one day
			

				
				ok i will load an old image

				perry you had said before
			
				
				
				that we could approximate b
			
				
				
				by the circumference of the circle
			
				
				
				can you remind us how we would do that
			
				
<br>				perry:
				well i think you said it
			
				
				
				but i think it\'d just be C / # of sides
			

<br>				avital:
				now before we proceed
			
				
				
				why can we allow ourselves to approximate here
			
				
				
				if we want the end result to be a full equality?
			
				
<br>				perry:
				it approximates better & better as the # of sides increases
			
				
<br>				avital:
				yes this is sort of tomer\'s idea
			
				
				
				of
			
				
<br>				perry:
				so if we accept tomer\'s idea
			
				
<br>				avital:
				"a circle is a polygon with infinitely many sides"
			

				
				yes
			
				
				
				so b = C / number of sides
			
				
				
				what about h?
			
				
				
				can we approximate h?
			
				
				
				in a way that works if the number of sides gets very very large?
			

<br>				tomer:
				i actually had a sort of idea how to proceed from the octagon
			
				
<br>				avital:
				oh would you like to share?
			

<br>				tomer:
				i think that if we choose only certain type of polygons we can find some formula
			
				
				
				the octagon was comfortable because it was double the triangles of the square
			
				
<br>				avital:
				hmmm
			

<br>				tomer:
				and i could play with the angles in such a way to get 45 degrees
			
				
<br>				avital:
				may i suggest that since we are close to the end of our time we continue on this path now and perhaps we can explore yours in another meeting?
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				i tried something with a 12 sided polygon and found a 30 degrees angle
			
				
				
				sure
			
				
<br>				avital:
				ok so lets say we don\'t have an approximateion for h
			
				
				
				but we do for b
			
				
				
				b ~ C / # of sides
			
				
<br>				perry:
				yea... but i think that\'s b/c 360 / 6 = 60, 360 / 8 = 45, 360 / 12 = 30
			
				
				
				i think after that it gets tough
			

				
				anyway
			
				
<br>				avital:
				
			
				
				
				so what is the area of the octogon?

				or sorry
			
				
				
				in general
			
				
				
				if we have an N-sided polygon
			
				
				
				(where we sort of think that N is a massively large number, sort of infinity)
			
				
				
				so that we can sort of almost say that b = C / N
			
				
				
				then what is the area of this N-sided polygon?
			

				
				...does my question make sense?
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				for me yeah
			
				
<br>				avital:
				would you like to answer it? :)
			
				
<br>				perry:
				N * 1/2 * b * h = N * 1/2 * C / N * h = C * h / 2
			
				
<br>				avital:
				oh
			
				
				
				wow
			
				
				
				hmm
			
				
				
				wow
			
				
<br>				perry:
				sorry
			
				
<br>				avital:
				seems right to me
			

				
				
			
				
				
				no need for sorry :)
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				?
			
				
<br>				avital:
				thanks

				ok
			
				
				
				and what is the circumference of this N-sided polygon?
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				c
			
				
<br>				avital:
				
			

				
				hehehe
			
				
				
				oh yes you\'re right
			
				
				
				SO
			
				
				
				let\'s see if this helps us in any way

<br>				perry:
				the last step is that b -> 0 as N -> inf
			
				
				
				so h -> r yes?
			

<br>				avital:
				yes as N grows very large h and r become very very similar
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				yes
			
				
				
				using c and N we can do it with pythagoras
			
				
<br>				avital:
				so perry how can we use that
			
				
<br>				perry:
				
			
				
<br>				avital:
				well i don\'t even know if we need to use pythagoras since
			
				
				
				i mean
			
				
				
				if we are ok with "b = C/N"
			
				
				
				then we should be equally intuitively ok with "h=r"
			
				
				
				for very very large values of N
			

				
				("for N -> infinity")
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				yes
			
				
<br>				avital:
				use undo
			
				
<br>				perry:
				i am really struggling with the tablet
			
				
				
				
			
				
<br>				avital:

<br>				tomer:
				that\'s cool
			
				
<br>				avital:
				do we agree?
			
				
				
				let\'s clean up the board a little and focus on the important parts
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				though we do make some strange assumptions
			
				
<br>				avital:
				
			

				
				you mean the assumption that h = r
			
				
				
				and b = C/N?
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				yep
			
				
				
				the second one is even stranger
			
				
<br>				avital:
				ok not sure how to clean the board enough
			
				
				
				well yes
			
				
				
				i mean
			
				
				
				mathematics has different levels of rigor
			

				
				but this seems reasonable enough to me (in a certain way)
			
				
				
				thought i\'d be curious to see the path that you were taking us since it was more exact
			
				
				
				but seemed more complicated
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				yeah maybe not today..
			
				
<br>				avital:
				also we can look at this whole question
			
				
				
				in a purely geometrical way
			
				
				
				
			
				
				
				<img src='http://www.twiddla.com//images/arrow1.gif' alt=''/> http://www.twiddla.com/addins/blank.html - cached
			

				
				we can try
			
				
				
				to take apart this octogon
			
				
				
				and rearrange the triangles in another way
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				interesting
			
				
<br>				avital:
				anyone have an idea?
			

<br>				jerry:
				can you select sectinos?
			
				
				
				with the whiteboard tools
			
				
<br>				avital:
				dont think so
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				that would be sweet
			
				
<br>				avital:
				yes
			
				
				
				
			
				
				
				so basically
			

				
				if i put two triangles
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				oh this grid view is nice
			
				
				
				for drawing
			
				
<br>				avital:
				touching each other as i drew
			
				
				
				
			
				
				
				i get some shape
			
				
				
				and i can do that for all of these 8 triangles
			
				
				
				
			
				
				
				or something

				but the main cool thing is that we can do this for a circle as well
			
				
				
				!
			
				
				
				
			
				
				
				<img src='http://www.twiddla.com//images/arrow1.gif' alt=''/> http://www.twiddla.com/addins/blank.html - cached
			
				
				
				its hard for me to draw this

				but what would we get if we take apart these pizza slices
			
				
				
				and put them together
			
				
				
				one facing up
			
				
				
				and one facing down
			
				
				
				
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				a long rectangle
			
				
				
				or something close to that
			
				
<br>				avital:
				yes, and the more slices we split the circle into
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				you get dissonant sound!
			
				
<br>				avital:
				the closer to a rectangle this thing will be
			

				
				can we find the area of this pseudo-rectangle?
			
				
<br>				perry:
				well the height is obviously the radius
			
				
<br>				avital:
				
			
				
<br>				perry:
				maybe not obvious :)
			
				
<br>				avital:
				hehehe
			
				
				
				let\'s say that it\'s obvious for now:)
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				c/2!
			
				
<br>				avital:
				what is the base
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				yesss
			

<br>				avital:
				so what is the area of the rectangle?
			
				
				
				
			
				
				
				
<img src='http://www.twiddla.com//usermedia/12767818/full/snap_40024373.png' alt='untitled'/>

				r*c/2
			
				
<br>				perry:
				
			
				
<br>				avital:
				so what is the area of the circle?
			

<br>				perry:
				r * c /2
			
				
<br>				avital:
				yes, ! because it is the same as the rectangle
			
				
				
				we just cut it apart and rearranged it
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				YAY
			
				
				
				we r genuis!
			
				
<br>				avital:
				so we\'ve shown that Area of cirlcle = r*c/2
			
				
				
				
			
				
				
				
<img src='http://www.twiddla.com//usermedia/12767818/full/snap_40024442.png' alt='untitled'/>

				and basically this is another way of showing the same thing
			
				
				
<br>				:
			
				
				
				namely A/r^2 = C/2r
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				that\'s awesome
			
				
<br>				avital:
				yes i agree that that\'s awesome
			

				
				this concludes what i had prepared. does anyone have questions or comments?
			
				
<br>				perry:
<br>				comment:
			
				
				
				
			
				
<br>				jerry:
				yes indeed
			
				
<br>				avital:
				
			
				
<br>				tomer:
				and it\'s really easy to see once you had the genius to show you the pizza thing
			
				
<br>				perry:
